# [Introduction to Serverless][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]

The serverless computing concept is an up-and-coming execution model that tries to address the needs of modern cloud-based software. Of course, it doesn’t work without servers, but the responsibility of maintaining the servers is shifted from the customer to the cloud providers. That means you don't need to worry about having resources for sudden bursts in demand or have a strategy to ensure high availability of a service.

In this course, Markus Mühlberger will show you how to use Amazon Web Services to create a "serverless" web app, complete with a REST API back-end. You'll also see how to deal with some advanced scenarios like integrating other AWS services and orchestrating state-aware functions. Along the way, you'll build a cool web service to convert text to speech.

## Source Files Description:

The source files contain all the functions that were created during the course, sorted by the lesson they were created in.

Instead of a hard coded bucket name, the source files include `process.env.BUCKET_NAME`, which is uses environment variables, so you can easily copy and paste the example code.
